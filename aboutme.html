    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <img class="shift" src ="images/studentvue_picture.PNG" alt="professional">

    <div class="right">
    <p>When I first started coding I knew that it was what I wanted to do.
     In the future, I would like to become a software engineer for a tech company in the bay area. 
     In order to achieve this, I have enrolled in many high level courses at my high, along with pursuing extracurricular activities that relate to computer science. 
     I would then apply to college to get a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. 
     The reason why I am interested in computer science is because I find coding interesting and I have always been interested in technology. 
    </p>
    <p>During my first year of high school I participated in extracurricular activities,
    such as Football and Riverside County Youth Advisory Council. 
    By constantly exercising on the football team this has helped me become healthier. 
    The Youth Advisory Council helped me become a better public speaker and be able to help my community.
    </p>
    <p>My experiences in these activities have helped me grow as a person. 
    I have become a team player and motivated by playing on my high schoolâ€™s football team last year. 
    It helped me realize that you can achieve better results when you work as a team. 
    It also helped me become more outgoing due to the fact that there had to be constant communication between you and your teammates. 
    By taking time consuming clases along with my extracurriculars, I had to learn how to manage my time. 
    This has made me become more punctual in everything that I do.
    </p>
    <p>I hope be able to become a software engineer throughout my life while always improving as a person. 
    I invite you to explore the rest of my site and I thank you for taking the time to read about me.
